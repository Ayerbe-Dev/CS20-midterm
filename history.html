    <span id = 'bodytext'>founder, Henry Forest, was a lover of the outdoors from a young age. 
        As a child he would often venture off into the woods behind his house and as he grew older, would
        spend hours exploring local trails and hiking mountains. He had a deep appreciation for the natural world
        and was a lover of adventure.
    </span>
    <br><br>
    <span id = 'bodytext'>As he grew into a teenager and eventually a young adult, Henry became accustomed to taking on
        longer and more dangerous journeys he often had to fend for himself. He and his fellow adventures often had to
        make do with drinking from rivers, sleeping in shoddy tents with no heat and traveling either by foot or with vehicles
        ill suited to rough terrain.
    </span>
    <br><br>
    <span id = 'bodytext'>These experiences gave Henry an idea. What if there was a company that could provide tools and 
        equipment for the adventures of the world. A company, that at the same time could spread his love of the outdoors
        with the wider population. And so, Green Mountain Outfitters was born.
    </span>
    <br><br>
    <span id = 'bodytext'>Although our founder has unfortunately passed way, Green Mountain and Henry's dream of helping
        spread the spirit of adventure and aiding those who pursue it still lives on. Once a small enterprise, Green Mountain has
        become one of the largest companies in its field will continue to pursue Henry's dream.
