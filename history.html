            founder, Henry Forest, was a lover of the outdoors from a young age. 
            As a child he would often venture off into the woods behind his house and as he grew older, would
            spend hours exploring local trails and hiking mountains. He had a deep appreciation for the natural world
            and was a lover of adventure.

        <span id="bodytext">
            As he grew into a teenager and eventually a young adult, Henry became accustomed to taking on
            longer and more dangerous journeys. He often had to fend for himself. He and his fellow adventures often had to
            make do with drinking from rivers, sleeping in shoddy tents with no heat and traveling on foot or with vehicles
            ill-suited to rough terrain.

        <span id="bodytext">
            These experiences gave Henry an idea. What if there was a company that could provide tools and 
            equipment for the adventurers of the world? A company that could, at the same time, share his love of the outdoors
            to a wider population. And so, Green Mountain Outfitters was born.

        <span id="bodytext">
            Although our founder has unfortunately passed away, Henry's dream of fostering the spirit of adventure 
            and the community which pursues it lives on. From our humble roots as a one-man enterprise, Green Mountain has
            grown to become one of the largest companies in its field and we continue to pursue Henry's dream every day.
